       " 'the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly',\n",

The **numpy** packaged uses **arrays** instead of **lists**. They aren't much different from lists, in that they can be indexed and worked with in similar ways. The function `np.where` gives us the **indices** where a certain value appears in a numpy array."
