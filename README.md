# kahs-nn
A neural network and computer vision workshop for students at Kutztown Area High School

# Intro to Python

You can find resources for learning the syntax and basics of python in `intro_python`.

# Demos

## Data Anaalysis
Several demos can be found in `intro_python/demos` showing how Python is used in science for data analysis.

## Computer Vision
We have a Jupyter notebook explaining basic image processing with filters to make edge and face detectors in `cv_filters/computer_vision_filters.ipynb`.

## Neural Networks
We have a Jupyter notebook explaining how to train and use a neural network in Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, found in `digits/digit_classifier.ipynb`.

We have a Jupyter notebook explaining how to use a Convolutional Neural Network to classify cat and dog images in `cats_or_dogs/cat_or_dog.ipynb`.
